# DPI Tunnel README

DPI Tunnel is a Python application that helps users bypass internet censorship and surveillance by creating an encrypted tunnel between the user's device and a server and with help of spliting client hello packet. 

It uses Cloudflare IP addresses to avoid detection and supports multiple Iranian operators.

This project was built using Python and other tools such as Kivy and KivyMD.
